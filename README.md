# JavaScript-Work-Sample

This repository is contained with some snippets which I generally write in my everyday work:

#1_Task:

The task was to create a screen, where a particular brief information from backend API record has to be shown in a well-defined display along with its relevant meta information in a complex tab-wise subscreen of it. To achieve this requirement, I had to make at least 15+ REST API similar calls in order to get and manipulate the data for meta-information tabular screen set area.

#1_Approached_To_Solve:

```
echo "hello world";

```
